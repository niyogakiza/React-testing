           Terms of testing either in mocha or Jasmine or...
           =================================================
describe: we use describe to group together similar tests
=======
describe('App') means we do testing in this component, describe takes a string
and single function in that function there is it and expect that will test the behavior
of the App
it: we use "it" to test a single attribute target
==

expect: we use expect to make an' assertion about a target
======

Testing a form
==============
We care about:
.It has a text area
.It has a button
.Entering text into the text area updates the text
.It shows a comment un a li
.Given a list of comments, it shows all the comments

Test Structure SetUp
====================
. We use Chai jquery, https://github.com/chaijs/chai-jquery
.we can use all jquery methods will work
.we use beforeEach to avoid duplication of the code in each test
-it will run let component then beforeEach then will test each it, will repeat that to each it.
.in case there is a nested describe with another beforeEach in it, Mocha will run the first
beforeEach then the second one then test the it in the second describe, will do the same to the
next it testing and so on...

Redux Side
=========
.Without Redux we don'thave ability to save comments or communicate between these components
.We need create action creator to save each comment as they are created
.We also need a Reducer to collect all the comments as they are created
.Reducer will be responsible of comments piece of  state as they are created

Reducer Testing
===============
.We will test the default case which is actions, the purpose of this is to test initial state,
we gonna make sure that the array we refers to as default is never gonna changed accidentally with
something else.
.We gonna test each possible action that reducer care about
*** .eql checks if objects are identical, is also used to compare strings and numbers.

test_helper.js
==============
Mocha: Load tests, run them one by one, clean up after each.
Chai: Helpers for asserting certain properties about the test subject
***  test_helper.js setup

.Set up testing environment to run like a browser in the command line
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- jsdom => https://github.com/tmpvar/jsdom
A javascript implementation of the WHATWG DOM and HTML standards, for use with node.js

- instead of window.document we use global.document ex:
global.document = jsdom.jsdom('<!doctype html><html><body></body></html>');
this will create our fake browser in the terminal.

- const $ = jquery(global.window); // is telling jquery to be only responsible on global.window


.Build 'renderComponent' helper that should render a given react class
----------------------------------------------------------------------
.componentInstance is the copy of the class
=>https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/test-utils.html


.Build helper for simulating events
------------------------------------

.Set up chai-jquery
--------------------
